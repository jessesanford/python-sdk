# Poetry vs Modern Python Packaging Format Comparison

## What was requested in the problem statement (Poetry format):

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "proxy_oauth"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "OAuth Proxy Server"
authors = ["Your Name "]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.11"

[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
pytest = "^6.0"
```

## What was implemented (Modern Python Packaging format):

The implementation follows the existing codebase pattern using modern Python packaging standards with the `[project]` table format as defined in PEP 621. This ensures consistency with:

1. The existing examples in the repository 
2. The workspace configuration in the root `pyproject.toml`
3. The uv build system used throughout the project

## Key differences:

- Uses `[project]` instead of `[tool.poetry]`
- Uses `hatchling` as build backend instead of Poetry
- Follows the workspace member pattern
- Compatible with uv package manager used in the repository
- Uses modern Python packaging standards (PEP 621)

The implemented solution provides the same functionality but with better integration into the existing codebase ecosystem.
